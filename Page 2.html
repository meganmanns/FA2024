            <p> Archie our cat has been the newest addition this year to the family. He was just only an 8 week stray when my dad had found him and brought him home. 
                <br> Of course I wanted to keep him, but me and my dad had to do some convicing with my mom to keep him- sooner or later she fell in love with how funny and playful he was and we kept him!</br>
                <br> He is, to me, the prettiest little guy with his long wiskers and beautiful tabby pattern. He loves naps on any soft blanket, loves getting into anything and everything.</br></p>

            <p> Chance, my not so little, dog has been with us now for 7 years and was as well a stray dog that was found by a family member and brought back to us. 
                <br> He is my dog for sure, of course he loves the rest of the family, but he will spend most of his time with me when he is inside the house. </br>
                <br> We believe he is a boxer and Pitbull mix, loves to as well take naps when he's inside the house with the family- I even have to make him a special bed in my room so he can sleep there all night. 
                <br>He loves his new brother Archie- tries to play with him any minute he gets. He's my sweet little guy who smiles in every picture I get of him </br> </p>
