        <em> Bad and Ugly Websites reading</em>
    </h1>
    <p>
        From just looking at the overall view of these websites they seem very overwhelming, but intriuging at the same time.
        <br> Intruiging by bringing back this nostalgic feeling of the earlier 2000's and looking at the internet as a kid</br>
        <br>Especially looking at the Santa@Northpole4Kids.com, this feels like a personal little site where someone wanted to bring the magic back to people.</br>
        <br> Even though looking at it now makes me want to turn my laptop off for awhile, I still feel like the inner child in me all excited because Santa is on my screen.</br>

    <p>
        All of these sites feel personal to the writer- like a little place to barf their creative visions for certain things they like.
        <br> They certainly have my attention- as a young me and older me but two different types of feelings towards these sites.</br>
        <br> I think more now of how far websites asthetics and interactions have been improved but its nice to see where it was before now.</br>
