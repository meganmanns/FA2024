    <h4 class="sub"> Changing and Growing</h5>

    <p>
        Understanding that change isn't happening in the sense of replacing the old traditions or the newer ones and moving onto another, but its the motivaitons and patterns that are changing which i completely agree with.
        Patterns in the economy change due to whatever is the current demand from the people who are surfing online.
        <br>
        As much too as we try to set a pattern to be a dominant application it'll change- it'll never really stay the same forever. Now it could be the same for some time, but that could just be in between the buffer time of creating a new pattern, a new system to be using.
        It's also interesting to think, within the second analogy, that these patterns that don't come forth with importance as much as others doesn't mean entirely they will never thrive.
        They continue over time to grow with how the world is growing and at some point may become the main focus and pattern that we use.

    <h4 class="sub"> Attention</h4>

    <p>
        I certainly agree that keeping one's attention on the internet is very important- but how it is done will determine its effectiveness.
        <br> 
        looking at this site, if i were to come about it without any prior say so, I wouldn't stay long on it. But if it were to be more interactive- like how they explain
        "that is why we ask for some information" it may be a different story. Or reel me in how I unconciously follow certain instructions paired with certain body movements.
