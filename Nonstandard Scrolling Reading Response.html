    <h1> THEY ARE SO COOL!</h1>

    <br><br><br>

    <p>
        Looking at these sites were really cool and fun interacting with them, interactions to me make website a lot more fun and snazzy. 
        <br>
        The interactions for some of the sites, to me, felt misleading or should've been explored more.

    <h2> Samurai Website</h2>
    <p>
        When looking at the Samurai website, I enjoyed most of the scroll interaction. Especially when i reached the middle section and it began to position the picture portions with the history point it begins talking about.
        Being able to follow along with the story without having to guess or having the interaciton be too slow that it feels like its dragging the story in a negative way. I like the fast-pace cut to the portion, then to another and then show the full picture and its full history. 

        <br>

        As well i think its smart with using the background images to promote the opening or to capture/acknowledge different sections of the website they talk about. 
        I do think though that some areas feel a little too long. The portion where they show different books laying on top of each other feels a little too long- that could've been easily resolved with a different interaction instead of just using scroll.

    <h2> Weedensenteret and Loreal</h2>
    <p>
        These two sites seem misleading with the interaction, i expected to be able to either click on the 3D object or to be able to move around the object when holding my cursor on the screen. 
        I dont enjoy having this slow scroll around the objects or not be able to click the objects/images. 
        Although all the other animations and interactions they have are nice, i just don't like that these first images that are presented on the screen you can't interact with them.

    <h2> Resn Website</h2>
    <p>
        I think this website solves the interaction problem the two sites above had. I really like being able to click this object and turn it 360 and then move onto the actual content of the site. It's a nice little opener to get the users intrigued of what the site may contain or what its about. 
        I think too these sites are the one that grab my attention more and is able to keep it for awhile due to the interaction feature it has.
